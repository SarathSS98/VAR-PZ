# VAR-PZ: Constraining the Photometric Redshifts of Quasars using Variability

# Requirements
1. Python < = 3.11.5
2. Celerite
3. Numpy (1.25 or lesser) and autograd
4. Matplotlib
5. LRT (https://github.com/rjassef/LRT/tree/Sarath) (See requirements there)
6. Astropy
   



## Usage
Check out the example.ipynb in demo

Note: The default version of SED modeling uses LRT (Assef et al. 2010) which does not support parallel processing. But, one can split the sample into chunks and initiate the process.

# The bandmag.dat file needs to be updated with the corresponding filters  

The file bandmag.dat needs to include all the filters youâ€™re using for SED fitting in the format Filter name, Magnitude units (1= Vega mags, 2= IRAC mags, 3 = AB), Zero point

A list of available filter names is here:

Example (SDSS filters)
sdssu   3   3767.

sdssg   3   3631.

sdssr   3   3631.

sdssi   3   3631.

sdssz   3   3565.
